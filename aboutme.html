                <p class='aboutText'>
                    So... My name is Matt Limbocker. I'm a twenty-something about to finish college, and
                    I'm hoping to get a job. I'm almost finished getting a Bachelor of Arts in Communication Technology from the University of Texas
                    at Arlington, and I'm really excited about getting out in to the real world and showing everyone what I can do.
                </p>
                <p class='aboutText'>
                	Wait a second...Commmunication Technology? What on earth does that mean? The Communication Technology program at UTA is all about
                    communicating via technology. While the main focus of the program is web design, I also have exposure to other fields such as Journalism,
                    Public Relations, and Marketing. This allows me to be really good at the technical aspects of designing a website while also being able
                    to produce a product that is ready for the masses.
                </p>
                <p class='aboutText'>
                	Okay. That's enough business. Let's get personal here. The first thing you need to know about me is that I'm a huge nerd, and I'm
                    incredibly proud of it. I love Science (both fact and fiction), I love working with computers, and I love music. I have quite a few
                    interests, but pretty much all of them can be thrown in to one or more of these three categories.
                </p>
                <p class='aboutText'>
                	Let's try a Question and Answer format here. It'll probably be easier that way.
                </p>
                <h2>Q: What do you like to do in your spare time?</h2>
                <p class='faqtext'>
                	A: When I'm not working, eating or sleeping, I'm usually either playing video games, tinkering with my computer, or keeping up with my
                    favorite TV shows.
                </p>
                <h2>Q: Speaking of favorite TV shows, what are they?</h2>
                <p class='faqtext'>
                	A: Hmmm...I've gotta break that question in to two parts because none of my all time favorites are on anymore. My all-time favorite TV shows that are
                    longer running are Battlestar Galactica (the 2004 series), Firefly and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (don't worry, I don't speak Klingon). 
                   	The currently running shows that  I watch regularly are, Doctor Who, The Big Bang Theory, Warehouse 13, Alphas, Burn Notice, Suits, White Collar, Leverage, 
                    Castle, Glee and New Girl.
                </p>
                <h2>Q: Do you like sports?</h2>
                <p class='faqtext'>
                	A: I think this is where I'm unique as a nerd. Most people think nerds aren't in to sports, but my car radio is always tuned to sports talk. I love baseball (go Rangers!),
                    I've been a College Basketball fan for years (Sic 'Em Bears! Rock Chalk Jayhawk!), and I love Soccer (go Liverpool! YNWA!) I also love Formula 1 Racing. F1 is one of 
                    those sports that I think a lot of nerds could get in to because of all of the technical aspects. I find it so interesting that I get up at 5am every other Sunday from 
                    March to November to watch the races live. So I guess the answer to that question is yes. I love sports!
                </p>
                <h2>You said you play a lot of video games...</h2>
                <p class='faqtext'>
                	A: That's not a question, but I'll give an answer anyway. I do play video games, but don't worry, I'm not one of those guys that goes in to withdrawals when he doesn't get
                    at least eight hours of video games in every day. My favorite games are racing games, but I also like shooters and strategy games.
                </p>
                <h2>Formula One...Racing Games...You like cars don't you?</h2>
                <p class='faqtext'>
                	Why yes! Yes I do! In fact, my favorite movie is a car movie. Gone in 60 Seconds
                </p>
